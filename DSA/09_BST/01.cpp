/*

A Binary Search Tree(BST) is a special type of tree where
    # Every node has at most two children
    # For Every Node -
        All values in the LST are smaller
        All values in the RST are greater
    # Both LST and RST are also BST

    # The inorder traversal of BST is always sorted
